# Music Purchase Research System

A simple, robust system to find the best place to buy music online. This system searches multiple music purchase sites and returns validated links to buy songs, prioritizing sites that support artists and offer high-quality downloads.

## Features

- **Dead Simple**: One function, one result - just pass a search term
- **Multiple Sites**: Searches Bandcamp and Beatport (more sites coming)
- **Smart Prioritization**: Prefers Bandcamp > Beatport > 7digital > Amazon
- **Validated Links**: All URLs are checked before returning
- **High-Quality Downloads**: Only returns sites with MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC files
- **No Streaming Services**: Focuses on actual music purchases only

## Quick Start
